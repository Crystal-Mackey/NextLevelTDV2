Given that the sun emits ultraviolet light, visible light, and near-infrared radiation, our advanced films with pristine optical clarity are engineered to regulate these energy bands based on specific consumer needs. Depending on your preference, you can select films that: Exclusively block ultraviolet (UVA & UVB) rays. Diminish visible light for glare control and an enhanced car aesthetic. Shield against both UVA & UVB rays and the majority of solar infrared, providing heat reduction without altering the window's appearance.",

As per the EPA EnergyStar Buildings Manual, in the U.S., around half of the typical household's utility expenses are due to heat loss and gain through windows that haven't been treated. By deflecting solar heat from outside and balancing indoor temperature fluctuations, window films can contribute to reducing heating and cooling costs, while also preventing heat from leaking out.",
